// People do not ask questions in sentences.
//
// The model is told to route every input to "capture" or "question", and it is
// good at the ones that look like questions — "how much did I spend on food
// this month" routes correctly every time. What it gets wrong is the way people
// actually type into a capture field once they trust it: "today spend". Two
// words, no verb, no question mark. The prompt calls capture the default and
// the overwhelmingly common case, which is true, so an ambiguous fragment lands
// there and the user gets a transaction form when they asked for a number.
//
// This is the deterministic half of the fix. The prompt teaches the model the
// shape; this catches the ones it still misses, without a second model call and
// without a credit. It runs only on a draft the model called a capture *and*
// that names no amount — a capture with an amount is a capture, whatever else
// the words look like, and that guard is what keeps a real expense from being
// swallowed by a question.
//
// Nothing here computes a figure or guesses at one. It produces the same
// query object the model would have produced, which then goes through
// `normalizeLedgerQuestion` and is answered in SQL like any other.

// metricWords maps the word people lead with to the metric it asks for.
//
// Ordered longest-first at match time, so "most expensive" is not read as a
// bare "most" and "how many" is not read as "how".
