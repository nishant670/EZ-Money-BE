// It drifted once: the mobile app added "Food & Drinks" and "Transport" to its
// picker while schemas/expense_entry.schema.json and internal/ai/prompt.txt
// still only knew the original six. The parser could not express either value,
// so every AI-captured meal was filed as "Food" and every auto rickshaw as
// "Travel", while manual entries used the newer names — the same spend split
// across two keys and every rollup quietly stopped being true.
//
// TestCanonicalCategoriesMatchParseSchema and TestCanonicalCategoriesMatchPrompt
// fail if these three ever diverge again.
//
// Clients read this list from GET /v1/categories rather than copying it, which
// is what keeps a fourth and fifth copy from appearing in the app and the web
// front end. TestCategoriesEndpointServesCanonicalList guards that route.
