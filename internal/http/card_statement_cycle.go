/*
Billing-cycle arithmetic for credit cards.

Every date a statement carries is derived from two numbers the user gives
once — the account's `statement_day` and `due_day` — and every one of them
stays editable afterwards, because banks shift dates for weekends and
holidays and the paper statement always wins.

The awkward cases are the ones that decide whether this is right: a card
billing on the 31st has no 31st in November, and a card billing on the 25th
and due on the 14th is due in the *following* month while a card billing on
the 2nd and due on the 22nd is due in the same one. Both fall out of the two
rules below rather than being special-cased.

// 30th; day 31 in a non-leap February is the 28th.
